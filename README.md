# Custom-TextField-Swift
With this component it is possible to optimize development, making your design more beautiful and providing the user with the best possible experience.

In this project I am using an extension to use contraints in a more agile way and also a protocol to make the code more indented and easier to understand, if you want to use it, just drag the ViewCodeProtocol folder to your project.

I created 3 different controllers with generic textField in both along with validation.

At the moment there are 3 types of textField, each one has a different design and with different validations, however they are all using the same "regex" validation method where in the file where the validators are located in the folder where the textField is located,

Take a good look at the code and try creating your own textField yourself, I hope I helped! Follow me on Linkedin: ihan carlos
